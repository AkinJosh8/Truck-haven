                    <h3 id="heading"> History</h3>
                <p class="traders-1">Admiral Trucker (Nig) Limited logistics operation history predates its 
                    birth as a unique Nigerian corporate citizen with its incorporation on 
                    October 16th, 2008. Before that date, Admiral Trucker (Nig) Limited 
                    operated as an integral component of the multi- venture concern, Admiral
                    Autotraders (Nig) Limited, which businesses cover, truck sales andservices-online
                    terrestrial; internet-based automobile search engine services; sales/marketing 
                    of truck-related products and services; oil and gas haulage; general goods, 
                    equipment shipment and logistics services.</p>
                <p  class="traders-2">With phenomenal growth of the unit components of the above-mentioned businesses
                    come diverse operational challenges, which necessitated a comprehensive 
                    reappraisal of the Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited business model. Closely
                    moderated by Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited core objective of raising the
                    bar in all spheres of business it undertakes in Nigeria, the review exercise 
                    involved inputs from employers and employees as well as its multifaceted clientele base.</p>
                <p  class="traders-2">As against Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited integrated approach, coming to all 
                    submissions was the imperative of operational independence for the various business
                    divisions in the organisation. And having decided to adopt the Unit Independence
                    Operational Concept, management took another radical step by way of confering distinct
                    corporate citizenship in the line with core trade or operations areas on each business
                    unit in Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited. The day-to-day operations of these business
                    entities would be executed without recourse to the centralised administrative apparatus
                    of Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited, management said, and thus was born Admiral Trucker
                    (Nig) Limited on October 16th, 2008.</p>
